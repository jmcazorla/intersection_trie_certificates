# Adaptive Set Intersection using Trie Certificates

This repository indexes two implementations of data structures and adaptive algorithms, based on compressed tries, designed for efficient set intersection. These implementations support the results presented in the paper "Adaptive Set Intersection using Trie Certificates" [cite the paper].

## Related Repositories

1.  **[Trie-Compressed Intersectable Sets](https://github.com/jpcastillog/compressed-binary-tries)**
    * Implements the BTries, rBTrie, H-TrieC, and rH-TrieC data structures, along with adaptive algorithms for processing intersection queries on these structures.

2.  **[Intersectable Sets with BK and BF](https://github.com/jmcazorla/binary_tries_BK_BF)**
    * Implements the H-TrieL and rH-TrieL data structures, and adaptive algorithms for processing intersection queries on these structures.

## Instructions

Each repository contains documentation describing the compilation and execution process of the experiments. It is recommended to consult these documents for information on the configuration and usage of the implementations.
